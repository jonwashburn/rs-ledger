# Navier-Stokes Global Regularity Proof

This directory contains the Lean 4 formalization of the global regularity proof for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, based on the Recognition Science framework.

## Structure

The proof is organized into 5 main files:

1. **Constants.lean** - All numerical constants derived from Recognition Science
   - C₀ = 0.05 (geometric depletion constant)
   - C* ≈ 0.354 (universal vorticity bound)
   - β = 0.11 (drift parameter)
   - And others...

2. **BasicDefinitions.lean** - Fundamental definitions
   - Velocity fields and divergence-free condition
   - Vorticity as curl of velocity
   - Leray-Hopf weak solutions
   - Navier-Stokes solutions with regularity

3. **GeometricDepletion.lean** - Constantin-Fefferman principle
   - Axis-alignment cancellation lemma
   - Angular sector decomposition
   - Main depletion theorem: |∇u| ≤ C₀/r

4. **VorticityBound.lean** - Universal scale-invariant bound
   - De Giorgi iteration machinery
   - Parabolic Sobolev embeddings
   - Main bound: |ω| ≤ C*/√ν

5. **GlobalRegularity.lean** - Main theorem
   - Combines all components
   - Beale-Kato-Majda criterion application
   - Final global regularity result

## Current Status

- ✅ Basic structure scaffolded
- ✅ All definitions in place
- ✅ Theorem statements match the paper
- ❌ 16 `sorry`s remain to be filled
- ❌ Need to add ParabolicHarnack.lean
- ❌ Need to add Bootstrap.lean

## Proof Strategy

The proof follows the paper's approach:
1. Establish geometric depletion with explicit C₀
2. Prove universal vorticity bound via case analysis
3. Apply drift-inclusive parabolic Harnack inequality
4. Use bootstrap mechanism to improve bounds
5. Apply Beale-Kato-Majda to conclude regularity

## Integration with Recognition Science

The constants are derived from the RS framework but the proof itself is self-contained and uses only standard PDE theory from mathlib4. No RS axioms are required for the logical structure.

## Next Steps

1. Fill in the geometric depletion proofs (angular sectors, optimization)
2. Complete the De Giorgi iteration details
3. Add the missing Harnack and Bootstrap files
4. Verify all numerical constants match the paper exactly
5. Run final zero-sorry check

## Building

From the root directory:
```bash
lake build
```

To check for remaining sorries:
```bash
grep -R "sorry\b" formal/NavierStokes | wc -l
